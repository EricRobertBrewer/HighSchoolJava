Taken verbatim from an email dating 10/15/07.

This is an unfinished version that I started in Java I in high school.
At this point, I had really only programmed for those 2-3 months, but I excelled.
The only other "programming" I had done had been in StarCraft in its Campaign Editor.
Campaign Editor had things like triggers, states, if-then-else logic, but it wasn't exactly code.

I remember finishing this game but apparently wasn't smart enough to email myself the completed version.
